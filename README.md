# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# Code structure

a) Load the data.table library

b) Dowload and unzip data

c) Merges the training data to create one data set.

d) Merges the test data to create one data set.

1. Merges the training and the test data to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

e) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
